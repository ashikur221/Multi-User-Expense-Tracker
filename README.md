# ðŸš€ Real-World Project: Multi-User Expense Tracker

We'll build a **Multi-User Expense Tracker** using **Context API** for state management and **Bootstrap** for design. This application will allow users to:

- âœ… Add expenses (title, amount, category)  
- âœ… Delete expenses  
- âœ… Filter expenses by category  
- âœ… Track total spending  
- âœ… Persist data in `localStorage`

## ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack  
- **React** (with Context API for global state management)  
- **Bootstrap** (for styling)  
- **LocalStorage** (to persist expenses across page reloads)
